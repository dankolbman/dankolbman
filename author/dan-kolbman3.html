					<p>Here I go through some data I've collected from Tinder biographies. If you're 
interested in how the data was collected, or you want to analyze or collect
your own data, you can get the scripts and some sample data I've collected
<a href="https://github.com/dankolbman/CleverTind">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in how the composite average was generated, check out
<a href="../face-avg.html">Picturing the Average Tinder Girl</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Emily" src="../trans_avg.png"></p>
<p>Meet Emily. A 21 year old, white, brunette who uses Tinder. She drinks coffee and
enjoys music. She likes wine almost as much as she does beer, and she favors
whiskey as far as liquor is concerned. She is the product of 100,065 Tinder profiles.</p>
<h2>Collecting the data</h2>
<p>It turns out that the Tinder API is pretty easy to exploit. It only requires a 
Facebook account with a connected Tinder app to verify and get a auth token. 
After that, all the calls used by the actual app become available to us and we're
free to wreck whatever havoc we like.</p>
<p>My bot for data collection is pretty simple. It requests suggestions from Tinder,
which will return a short list of profiles. Then the bot runs through the list and 
saves all the JSON data for the users, 'swiping' them along the way so they don't
come back in the future. It's all rinse and repeat from here, and after a while,
you end up with a bunch of profile data.</p>
<p>Profile data consists of a bunch of fields: Name, age, pictures, last activity,
biography, and more. Below I report some statistics on names, ages, and bio
data that I've collected from 100,065 profiles.</p>
<h2>What's her name</h2>
<p>After a quick analysis, the most common name was Emily, followed closely by 
Sarah.</p>
<p><img alt="Names" src="../names.png"></p>
<p>This doesn't include any variations of the names. For example, I found seven 
variations of Emily: Emilie, Emilee, Emi, Emile, Emili, Emleigh, and Emillie.
To sort through all of the possible variations would be a pain, and considering 
each of the top five are all pretty variable, I'll assume that this list is 
a good representation of the distribution. It might be interesting to inspect 
each name and look at how many variates each one has, but again, that would 
require a lot of hand sifting, so I won't do that here.</p>
<h2>How old is she</h2>
<p>The next obvious question is her age. Well the age distribution of female Tinder
profiles looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Ages" src="../ages.png"></p>
<p>So she's 21 according to the Tinder dates. However, I after inspecting bios, I 
found something that may challenge this. I looked at the mentions of the numbers
14-24 on Tinder bios. Now, Tinder users will know that there is often two
occasions in which a user will mention a number like this. One is when mentioning
graduating class, ie 'nyu 16'. The other is when the user is correcting the age
shown on their profile, ie 'I'm actually 18' (I believe this is often due to users 
lying about their age in order to create a Facebook account when their younger).
Either way, we could infer something about age from either of these cases. 
Here's what that distribution looks like across users:</p>
<p><img alt="Numbers" src="../numbers.png"></p>
<p>First thing we can note about this is the sudden drop in frequency when we get 
to 19. At first glance, I'd say that this is some supporting evidence that the
mention of these numbers in bios is mostly users mentioning class year. But if 
we consider that the class of 2018 also corresponds to a demographic of mostly 
18 year olds. We could either make the conclusion that 'Users tend to state their
class year in their profile with freshmen being more likely to than seniors' or
we could just as validly say that 'Users tend to correct their age on their profile
with 18 year olds doing so the most and 14 year olds the least'. Therefore, it's
inconclusive as to which statement is correct.</p>
<p>But there is one thing that this says that disagrees with the age reported by 
Tinder, and that's the fact that 18 is mentioned the most. Remember that 18 
corresponds to an age of 18 by either of the above cases. We should then think 
that the most common age should be 18, not 19. Of course there's a lot of other 
things to consider, like users who are 18 feel compelled to list their age. 
I would conclude that overall, the evidence points to the actual mean age being
lower than that reported by Tinder, but I'd take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<h2>What are her interests</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting data we can look at is in the user biographies. First
off, it's interesting to note that 53% of users had less than five words
in their bio. It seems like a lot of wasted opportunity there. The distribution 
shows that the length decays sub exponentially up to about 80 words, where it 
just dies off (note logarithmic scale).</p>
<p><img alt="Interests" src="../wc.png"></p>
<p>So then, let's look more closely at some details of the biographies. To do this,
I've looked at the word frequencies and compare them to the number of users as 
to represent the number of users that use a word in their profile. The actual 
word per percentage of users might be a little less than this, considering someone
might use a word multiple times, but I've assumed this unlikely and take it to be 
a good estimate.</p>
<p>My data parser spits out file of words with the number of times that word was 
used (sorted by use count). I scanned this file to find common words that might
fit part of a general and correlate them to imply things about the popularity of
something.</p>
<p>For instance, I started by looking at popular interests like the following:</p>
<p><img alt="Interests" src="../interests.png"></p>
<p>Well music is certainly far ahead of anything else. We can conclude that many Tinder
users enjoy music.  But just 'music' is rather ambiguous. Here are some of the
more popular genres I could find in the list.</p>
<p><img alt="Music Genres" src="../genres.png"></p>
<p>Country comes out with a strong lead with more than twice that of rock. Of course
country is also often used as a identifier, ie 'I'm just a country gal', but they
go hand in hand for the most part. Again, this popularity likely comes from one 
of the major demographics (upstate NY) in the data. Rock and punk could also be
used as adjectives unrelated to genre as well. Overall, we can get some deeper 
interpretation of popular genres from this, but it shouldn't be taken too seriously.</p>
<h3>Beverages</h3>
<p>Coffee was the obvious winner over tea, but surprisingly, beer came out just
above wine, though still not as popular as coffee.
<img alt="Beverages" src="../beverages.png"></p>
<p>As for liquor, it was pleasant to find that whiskey trumped all. In fact, the
others are mentioned so infrequently that I hesitate to call them statistically
meaningful.</p>
<p><img alt="Liquor" src="../liquor.png"></p>
<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>Hockey seems like it must be another demographic issue, but it could also be the 
fact that field hockey is also included in this statistic. 
<img alt="Sports" src="../sports.png"></p>
<p>Dogs are the clear favorite amongst users, which is not that surprising. If I 
took the time to train a classifier to identify dogs, I bet I could find a dog 
in nearly half of all profiles.</p>
