				</h1>
				<span class="post-date">Thu 08 January 2015</span>
				<p>
					<p>In this article, I'm going to discuss the steps I took to get an image of the 
average Tinder girl. If you're also interested in a general analysis of the 
average Tinder girl's profile, make sure to <a href="../meet-emily.html">Meet Emily: The Average Tinder 
Girl</a>.</p>
<p>You can get the scripts and the data I've collected <a href="https://github.com/dankolbman/CleverTind">here</a>.</p>
<h1>The Bot</h1>
<p>Tinder is a simple dating app that has become quite popular, popular enough to
attract bot accounts advertising purposes. Users of Tinder will be certainly be 
familiar with the bots that spam simple ads as well as those that semi-intelligently
respond to conversation leading into a more convincing ad. After dealing with 
these bots myself, I was intrigued by how I might go about making my own bot for
entertainment purposes. It turns out that it's actually relatively easy. The 
Tinder API only requires a Facebook authentication token of an account with an 
active Tinder app to retrieve a token for Tinder's API. After that, the Tinder
API is wide open. There's even a couple unofficial wrappers available, I'm using
Tinder Pyro <sup id="fnref-tinder_pyro"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-tinder_pyro">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After some preliminary fooling around, the treasure trove of data soon became 
evident. I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it, but I had my bot
downloading and storing profile data anyway. After a week I had a couple gigs of
data and by the time I figured what to do with it all, I had gone through over 
a hundred-thousand profiles. What was I going to do with all that? It seemed 
pretty obvious. Let's construct the average Tinder girl! So then...</p>
<h1>What does she look like?</h1>
<p>With all those photos, we should be able to build up some idea of what this girl
looks like. Well a quick and dirty attempt at getting an image of our girl is to
blindly average all the profile pictures I've collected. Here's what I got after
adding 62820 primary profile photos together:</p>
<p><img alt="Detected" src="../posts/faceavg/prof_avg.png"></p>
<p>It sure doesn't show any detail, but there is some sign that this is a human being.
If you squint you can make out a flesh-tinted blob around the center. Perhaps
that's a hint of shoulders on the lower half? I was quite surprised that anything
of remote resemblance to a person came out of this. Of course this isn't even
close to what we're looking for, and fortunately, we can still do better.</p>
<h1>Getting rid of the junk</h1>
<p>If you've swiped through Tinder profiles before, you'll know there's a lot of
variation in the pictures. Some are from far away, some at strange angles, 
sometimes it's a group shot, or maybe there isn't even a person in it! Sorting 
out all the awful pictures that are ruining my average is going to help out a
lot. If only we could check that each picture being averaged is of a person.
Well, thankfully face detection is something that is widely studied and quite 
easy to use. OpenCV has a cascade classifier<sup id="fnref-cascade_classifier"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-cascade_classifier">2</a></sup> for detecting 
objects and even comes with some pre-trained cascades for face detection.
Awesome! Here's the meat of what I'm doing to find faces in an image:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">face_cascade</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cv2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CascadeClassifier</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">haar_map</span> <span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">gray</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cv2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cvtColor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">img</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cv2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">COLOR_BGR2GRAY</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">faces</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">face_cascade</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">detectMultiScale</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">gray</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">scaleFactor</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mf">1.2</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">minNeighbors</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">minSize</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">),</span>
  <span class="n">flags</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cv2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cv</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CV_HAAR_SCALE_IMAGE</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once we get the faces in the image, it's time to check that it's an acceptable 
picture There's only two criteria I'm going to match for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there exactly one face in the photo?</li>
<li>If so, is it at least 100x100px large?</li>
</ol>
<p>If both of these criteria are met, great! We'll average it. If not, just ignore it.
Here's what happens after sorting through the same profile pictures as before:</p>
<p><img alt="Detected faces" src="../detect_avg.png"></p>
<p>This is after sorting through the same 62820 profiles as before. The detection 
method narrowed it down to 21001 positive samples (that's 33.56%).
And, ehh, It's better, a little. There's more shape to the head. There's some sign of a chest
and neck now too. At the very least, I'd say this is good enough evidence to say
that the average girl on Tinder is white (or our cascade is biased!). But we 
still don't have any features, let alone something that can be identified as a
face!</p>
<h1>Bringing her into focus</h1>
<p>There's one thing that the cascade classifier is doing that is making the average 
only 'meh' and that is that it doesn't care about the location of identified faces.
The classifier will detect a face anywhere in the image, but I want something 
like a portrait-like result. This means that just a mere detection is still going
to result in a blurry, out of focus, image. Clearly we need some better cooperation.
The classifier does report the location of each object it detects. Let's try
 scaling each photo to frame only the reported face and average those. This is 
pretty easy to do with OpenCV using a perspective transform<sup id="fnref-transform"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-transform">3</a></sup>. Here's how I do that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">face</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">float32</span><span class="p">([[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">],[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">],</span>
                   <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="p">],[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="p">]])</span>
<span class="n">frame</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">float32</span><span class="p">([[</span><span class="n">pic_w</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">pic_w</span><span class="p">],</span>
                    <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">pic_h</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">pic_w</span><span class="p">],</span>
                    <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">pic_w</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">pic_h</span><span class="p">],</span>
                    <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">pic_h</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">pic_h</span><span class="p">]])</span> 
<span class="n">M</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cv2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getPerspectiveTransform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">face</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">frame</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">new_img</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cv2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">warpPerspective</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">img</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">M</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pic_w</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">pic_h</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, I'm taking the bounding box of the face and having OpenCV get the transform
required to make it be framed in the full picture. I then apply that transform 
to the image, and carry on with the averaging from there. After that, we get a
nice picture:</p>
<p><img alt="Detected and transformed" src="../full_101.png"></p>
<p>Now that's pretty good! This is for the same 21001 positive samples as before, 
only now they've been centered properly. </p>
<h1>An actual average</h1>
<p>There's still a problem with the averaging, however. If we make a comparison of
different averages for different numbers of samples, we can see they don't 
really change after a certain point.</p>
<p><img alt="Comparison" src="../compare_small.png"></p>
<p>The problem is that our profile images are only 8-bit JPEGs and are being 
processed as such. This means that we're going to have trouble with precision
when we start getting close to 256 samples. That's clearly not good enough when
there's more than 10000 images to be combined! To counter this, I could covert 
all the images to some higher bit-depth, but instead I've chosen to simply save 
the average of every 100 positive samples and then average all of those. In 
addition, I'm also using a numpy ndarray with a type of float64 to hold all of 
my averaging data, so there shouldn't be any concern for precision issues in this
method.
After all this, we get our girl:</p>
<p><img alt="Detected" src="../trans_avg.png"></p>
<p>It's pretty clear that there is a lot less noise than the last attempt, which 
we should expect from so many samples. Even more, we can even use our cascade to
see if the result is identifiable as a face:</p>
<p><img alt="Detected" src="../detected.png"></p>
<p>And it turns out it is! That shouldn't be too surprising seeing as it's 
just an average of positive matches. Though it's still evidence to show that
the bounding boxes on the detected faces were consistent enough to provide a strong
average.</p>
