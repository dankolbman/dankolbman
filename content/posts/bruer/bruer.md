A few weeks ago I recieved my first [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) backed (physical) product, the [Cold Bruer](http://www.bruer.co/). So far, I've been pretty happy with my backing.

# Design

There are a couple draw backs on the design that I'm not happy with. First, the glass is rather thin and seems kinda flimsy. It's held up to inserting the drip mechanism and has survived a couple bumps, but I fear that it might break as easily as being accidentally hit with a piece of silverware. The thickness has appearently already been reported as Andy and Gabe have already mentioned looking into new production methods[^update].
Another issue is the tower height. The pitcher holds a sizable volume. But, because the grounds hang down into the glass, only a third of it can be filled with brewed coffee. It would be nice if this additional space went into the steeping portion rather than a partially filled pitcher wasting space in the fridge. This is a little nit-picky though, considering proper drip brewers are close to four foot tall[^yama].
